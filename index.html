    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class=”paragraph”><strong>Name</strong></p>
    <p class=”paragraph”>Paul Benson</p>
    <p class=”paragraph”><strong>Biography</strong></p>
    <p class=”paragraph”>I am currently a Business Growth Officer within a Local Authority and I have a strong background of business development and marketing within both the private and public sectors, and I am currently responsible for development and maintenance of two websites via WordPress. I have a keen interest in digital technologies and am looking to learn Software Development skills with the help of CODE Lancashire. 
    <p class=”paragraph”><strong>Challenges & Successes</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018</li>
      <p class=”paragraph”>Between July and September 2020, whilst still working as part of the Business Grants Support Team, I was responsible for a complete website rebuild for a our inward investment website. This was to ensure that the website met the new Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018, which was a legal requirement by 23 September 2020. By using my organisational skills, I was able to work effectively on my own to create a clear plan of key milestones and dates to ensure the delivery of the project before the deadline.</p>
      <p class=”paragraph”>Whilst fulfilling two different roles simultaneously, I was able to clearly demonstrate my ability to prioritise my workload and multi-task when required, ensuring that the customer experience for our Service Area was still being delivered to the highest possible standard to ensure that the organisations visions and priorities were efficiently met.</p>
      <li>Announcement of COVID Business Support Grants</li>
      <p class=”paragraph”>When the first COVID Business Support Grants were announced, Local Authorities were completely unaware that it was happening, but businesses quickly began contacting us for more information to apply. I immediately and pro-actively developed and published (out of hours) an interim holding page with as much information as we could regarding the scheme, as I was fully aware that enquires and expectations would be high and it was our duty to do what we could, when we could.</p>
      <p class=”paragraph”>I carefully and concisely reviewed the Government guidance when it became available and created the online application forms required, ensuring that all the relevant data was collected. Ensured that the Local Authority website was reguarly updated with information as well as informing our Customer Services team, as they were front line service receiving most enquiries.</p>
      <li>Falling Customer Rention Rates</li>
      <p class=”paragraph”>During my time as a Business Development Manager, I had noticed that the number of paying subscribers to one of our services was in decline.</p>
      <p class=”paragraph”>By creating a targeted campaign with former customers, I was able to identify reasons why they hadn’t renewed their service with us which then enabled me to come up with ways to innovate our product. After this, I was able to successfully plan, design and implement a brand-new system which improved the customer experience and retention rates for the company. </p>
